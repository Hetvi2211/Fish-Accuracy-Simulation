# Project Ecosystem

This repository is part of a three-tier fish identification system:

- **[Deep Learning Model](https://github.com/Hetvi2211/Fish-Accuracy-Simulation)** - Core ML model for fish species identification and Similarity Search.
- **[API Backend](https://github.com/unnatii14/fish-classifier-api)** - RESTful API serving the ML model
- **[AquaVision Frontend](https://github.com/unnatii14/aquavision-flutter)** - User interface for fish identification

# Marine Drive Biodiversity Monitoring Using Deep Learning

This project focuses on monitoring marine biodiversity by detecting and classifying fish species using deep learning models.  
It uses cropped fish images and applies **transfer learning (EfficientNet)** to classify species effectively.

## üìä Dataset: 
- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/markdaniellampa/fish-dataset
- **Format:** Cropped `.png` images  
- **Structure:** Images are named with species labels.  
- The notebook extracts species names from filenames and prepares them for training/validation.
